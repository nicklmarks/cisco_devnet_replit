## Hello and welcome to the first Replit 'Debug Activity'!
## These activities have been created for you to test
## your comprehension, in a hands-on fashion, on the
## material we have covered up to this point in our course.
## Each activity lists the corresponding section on which
## it is based in the Python Institute course. For example,
## this first activity is based on the material we covered
## in Module 1.2.1.7 and will focus on the key concepts.
## Once you have completed the activity and have the code
## below running without any issues, just click submit!
## You can also view the 'solution set' for all activities
## after you submit your work by returning to the 'Teams'
## area, going back to the activity, and either 'Forking'
## the solution or 'Viewing' the solution.
## Okay, let's get started with our first activity!
##
## This activity is based on content from Module 1.2.1.7 
## There are two (2) errors in this Python file. See
## if you can identify and then fix both errors so 
## the program runs successfully. Good luck!

print("Hello World!")
