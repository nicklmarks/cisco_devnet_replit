## Welcome to 'Challenge Activity' 2.1.1.18.c02!
## To complete the Challenge Activity, take a look 
## at the image to the left (under main.py) and see if
## you can reproduce the output. This time, however,
## there are some constraints:
##
## 1. You have to use double quotes for all strings.
## 2. You can not use print() function statements that
##    have no arguments.
##
## Once you have completed this activity,
## you can 'Submit' your file and view
## the solution set for the activity or you can 'Fork'
## the solution set to have a copy with which to work.
## Good luck!
