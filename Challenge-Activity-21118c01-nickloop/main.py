## Welcome to 'Challenge Activity' 2.1.1.18.c01!
## To complete the Challenge Activity, take a look 
## at the image to the left (under main.py) and see if
## you can reproduce the output. This time, however,
## there are some constraints:
## 1. You have to use the keyword separators end/sep
##    as part of your solution.
## 2. You can only use a single print statement
##
## Once you have completed this activity,
## you can 'Submit' your file and view
## the solution set for the activity or you can 'Fork'
## the solution set to have a copy with which to work.
## Good luck!
